Inserts Math Equations on your posts. 

== Description ==

MathTex Equation Edtor is a Free and Open Source Wordpress plugin which is able to insert math equations on while adding/editing a post. It can also convert
equations made using the Codecogs editor to be rendered by the MathTex.cgi installation.

This plugin can be used with a mathtex.cgi installation provided at http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html or any other service that renders Math LaTeX if supplied 
with the markup text on the URL. By default, the latex equations are rendered by the free mathtex.cgi installation provided at http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=tx&chl=. 

To run mathTex.cgi installation on your own personal server, installation instructions can be found at http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.html. 
You can also look up my blog post on the step by step installation of mathTex.cgi at http://kobmat.com/math/?p=5805.

For a quickstart guide on how to work with Math LaTeX, you can check on the guide for the syntax at http://www.forkosh.com/mimetextutorial.html

Features:

1. Can work with a variety of Math Latex Rendering services. See Options for examples
2. Insert images of math equations on your WYSIWYG Editor when creating/editing a blog post
3. Convert equations in you created using codecogs to be rendered to your equations.
4. Easy to use Math Latex toolbar
5. Auto closes (, [, { and |, and inserts any selected text between the brackets, or parenthesis. Making typing equations a lot easier
5. Caches equations you insert into your blog post
6. Can be set to submit request to the Math Latex Rendering servers using PHP (gets around that annoying referrer error on post emails sent to subscribers)
7. Saves a history of the math latex mark up you inserted into your blog posts
8. Can Send entire equations or a selections of it to Wolfram Alpha

In the works:

1. Support for custom button on the toolbar for those most used latex mark up.
2. More icons especiall for matrices on the toolbar
